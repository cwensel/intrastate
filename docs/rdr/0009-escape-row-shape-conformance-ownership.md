## Metadata

- **Date**: 2026-08-09
- **Status**: Draft
  <!--
  - `Demoted` is the terminal status for an RDR judged
    *not RDR-shaped* — the decision was never a real
    design fork, so it leaves the RDR lifecycle and is
    refiled as a plain issue. Carry the destination on the
    live value: `Demoted [→ <issue link>]`, and record the
    same link under **Related Issues**. A `Demoted` RDR runs
    no further stages. (Distinct from the 08.1 *demotion*
    below, which is a `Final → Draft` flip that keeps the
    RDR in the lifecycle — that flip never writes
    `Status: Demoted`; see the disambiguation note there.)
  - A Draft demoted from Final by the 08.1 cluster gate
    carries a qualifier on the live value:
    `Draft [revised from Final YYYY-MM-DD; re-verify A2,A4
    — <one-line reason>]`. It is still a `Draft` for every
    binary Draft/Final gate; only Stage 4 (scoped
    re-verify) and Stage 8 (re-lock) parse the qualifier.
    The Stage 8 flip to `Final` overwrites the whole value,
    so the qualifier self-clears at re-lock — no separate
    cleanup. This 08.1 "demotion" is a *verb* describing the
    Final→Draft flip; it is **not** the `Demoted` status
    above (which exits the lifecycle to an issue) — do not
    conflate the two. (`Reverted` above is the unrelated
    terminal "implementation rolled back" status — also do
    not conflate.)
  -->
- **Type**: Architecture
- **Profile**: foundational — provisional; one contract
  (which layer guarantees that an escape row bears no writes
  and no clears, and in what form), but it binds RDR 0001's
  kernel `Row` vocabulary to RDR 0002's normalizer duty, so
  it spans two already-Final RDRs. Resolve overwrites from
  the verified count.
  <!-- Do not paste the matrix below into the field; it is the
  Stage 5 routing latch, provisional on `Draft`, made
  authoritative by Resolve.
  Sized by BLAST RADIUS — the MAX of two axes, not
  contract count or word count.
  (1) contract axis: small = one contract, no user-facing
  surface (skips Stage 5); mid = one contract + user-facing
  surface OR locks a contract; large = locks an enum/hash/
  format/grammar/destructive-op; foundational = cross-RDR
  producer / spans modules.
  (2) accretion axis (HARD floor): if `Seam Lineage` below
  carries ≥2 closed prior point-fixes at this locus, Profile
  is floored at FOUNDATIONAL regardless of the contract axis
  — a seam with prior point-fixes is never small/mid (it
  spans the prior RDRs/patches = the matrix's cross-RDR
  trigger). The only escape is a written accretion disposition
  in the Seam Lineage field. This floor is what stops a
  "one contract → mid" sizing from under-gating an accreting
  seam.
  Matrix: rdr/stages/README.md. Seed estimates from the design
  shape; Resolve overwrites from the verified count; Stage 8
  Gate locks it at Draft → Final. Never skip lenses off a
  Draft Profile until Resolve has run. -->
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Related Issues**: kata `tgzh` — "Escape-row shape
  conformance is unowned at the RDR 0001/0002 seam"
  (`src:roborev`, `severity:medium`,
  `area:internal-resolve`, `release:post-1.0`).
- **Predecessors**: 0001-resolution-kernel,
  0002-transition-table-as-reviewable-data
- **Overrides**: [To be determined at Propose — whether this
  RDR narrows RDR 0001's `Row` vocabulary, extends RDR
  0002's validation duty, or reopens RDR 0001's closed
  refusal taxonomy depends on which branch of the fork is
  chosen.]
- **Seam Lineage**: `area:internal-resolve` (escape-row shape
  conformance at the RDR 0001 ↔ 0002 boundary) — no prior
  accretion.

## Problem Statement

Someone authoring a transition table writes an escape rule
to say "when this failure class happens, leave by this
route." They expect an escape to be purely an exit — it
names where control goes, not what state gets written down.
They discover the problem only if something downstream
persists a tag they never authorized: the escape fires, the
route is right, and afterwards an owned tag has a value no
rule in their table ever set. Nothing in the disposition
tells them the write came along for the ride, because as far
as their table is concerned the write does not exist.

Internally, this RDR must fix **which layer guarantees the
invariant "an escape row bears no writes and no clears,"
and in what form that guarantee is carried**. RDR 0002
constrains the authored rule (an escape rule MUST NOT carry
a write block or clear list) and omits writes from the
escape row it renders, but ships no artifact that makes the
combination unrepresentable. RDR 0001's kernel accepts a
`Row` with both `Escape` and `Writes` populated and copies
whatever the row carries into the emitted `Plan`, having
explicitly deferred table shape to its peer ("Kernel assumes
a parsed, reviewable table shape"). The shared
`internal/resolve` `Row` type is the vocabulary both sides
speak, and it permits the illegal combination. Neither RDR
assigns the guarantee to anyone.

The decision is a single fork — **where trust is placed at
the 0001/0002 seam** — with three defensible branches: the
invariant is a **value-level obligation** discharged by RDR
0002's normalizer and lint, with RDR 0001's `Row` documenting
the precondition it trusts; it is a **shape-level
obligation**, with `Row` splitting into ordinary and escape
variants so the combination cannot be constructed; or it is
a **runtime predicate**, with the kernel refusing malformed
rows at evaluation. The third branch requires a new refusal
kind, which is why it reaches past this seam into RDR 0001's
closed five-kind taxonomy and RDR 0005's exit-code mapping —
a consequence of one answer, not a separate decision.

## Context

### Background

Raised by a roborev finding against the RDR 0001
implementation and triaged as kata `tgzh`. The reviewer read
RDR 0002's escape-rule prohibition, then read RDR 0001's
kernel, and found the prohibition had no enforcer on either
side of the seam.

Current behavior: `internal/resolve` defines a single `Row`
type carrying `Escape`, `Writes`, and `NextTags` together,
and the plan constructor copies `Writes` onto the emitted
plan without consulting whether the selection came from an
escape edge. A row populating both fields therefore produces
a write-bearing escape disposition.

Reachability today is narrow. The conforming RDR 0002
normalizer — the party that would reject such a rule — is
not yet implemented, so no production path constructs rows
at all; the combination is reachable only from
hand-constructed `resolve.Row` values, meaning tests and any
future non-TOML table producer. What makes it worth
adjudicating rather than dropping is the blast radius if it
did become reachable: an escape disposition describing
owned-tag persistence that no authored rule sanctioned,
handed to the RDR 0004 accessor layer — precisely the
"kernel guessing at persistence" that RDR 0001's ADV-2b
names.

Triage confirmed no Phase 3 assertion depends on escape
fixtures carrying `Writes`; every test still discriminates
if they are stripped, so the existing evidence base does not
constrain the answer. A related cleanup — `escapeRow` in
`internal/resolve/fixtures_test.go` populating
`Writes`/`NextTags` on an escape row — is mechanical, is
already recorded in RDR 0001's `triage.md` under "Noted, not
filed," and is **not** part of this RDR.

Triage also examined and rejected merging this with kata
`z53t` (RDR 0008): both sit at the 0001↔0002 seam, but this
decides the structural validity of a row *value* while 0008
decides the identity of a *name*. Disjoint answer spaces, no
ordering dependency.

### Technical Environment

Go CLI (`intrastate`). The seam spans:

- `internal/resolve` — the RDR 0001 resolution kernel.
  Owns the `Row` and `Plan` types, the escape-candidate
  path, and the plan constructor that copies a row's tag
  fields onto the emitted plan. Implemented (RDR 0001 is
  `Implemented`).
- RDR 0002 (`0002-transition-table-as-reviewable-data`,
  `Final`, not yet implemented) — owns the authored TOML
  rule grammar, the escape-rule prohibition on write blocks
  and clear lists, the normalized row rendering, and the
  validation categories including "malformed escape
  declaration."
- RDR 0001's refusal taxonomy — exactly five behavioral
  refusal kinds, deliberately closed, with no "malformed
  row" member.
- RDR 0005 (`0005-skill-integration-cli-contract`, `Final`)
  — maps refusal kinds to exit codes; touched only if a new
  refusal kind is introduced.
- RDR 0004 (`0004-accessor-execution-safety-model`,
  `Final`) — the downstream consumer of a plan's writes, and
  the layer where an unsanctioned write would take effect.

## Research Findings

### Investigation

[What was analyzed? Code, docs, source, experiments,
standards. Cite specific locations.]

### Key Discoveries

[Label each finding's evidence basis:

- **Verified** — confirmed by spike/POC/experiment
- **Documented** — from official docs or source reading
- **Assumed** — needs validation before implementation]

### Critical Assumptions

[Required — never omit. Load-bearing assumptions — if
wrong, the approach fails. Each must have a complete
Evidence Record before marking this RDR Final.]

- **A1 [Statement]**
  - **Status**: Verified | Pending | Unverified
  - **Method**: `one of the eight below`
  - **Evidence**: [single sentence — concrete artifact;
    see method-specific guidance below. Prefer a stable
    anchor: `path::Symbol`, section heading,
    REQ/assumption/test ID, grepable literal snippet, or
    artifact path. A bare `file:line` or peer-RDR
    `~line N` is non-normative — drop or rewrite to a
    stable anchor unless the line number **is** the
    behavior under test.]
  - **If wrong**: [single sentence — what fails; how
    it surfaces to a user or test]
- **A2 [Statement]** — (same shape)

**Method vocabulary** (Reference-only — guidance for
filling the **Method** field; do NOT copy this list into
the instance body. Pick exactly one per assumption):

- **Source Search** — verified against dependency
  source code. Evidence: a greppable `path::Symbol`
  (function/type/const name), **not a bare `file:line`**;
  a commit-SHA permalink only for audit/traceability.
  Standard for libraries. (Why symbol not line: flow
  README *Doctrine*.)
- **Spike** — verified by running code against a live
  service or fixture. Evidence: command run + path to
  captured output.
- **Prior Art** — same property holds in ≥1 named
  external system. Evidence: system + section/page.
- **Derivation** — pure math or proof. Evidence: the
  derivation, shown inline.
- **Design Decision** — a scoping choice this RDR is
  *making* (not *verifying*). Evidence: the decision
  and the alternative explicitly rejected.
- **Peer RDR** — relies on a property defined in
  another RDR. Evidence: RDR ID + section.
- **MVV Test** — the property is testable via the
  Minimum Viable Validation, and the test
  is named in this RDR's Validation section (pending
  implementation at lock time). Evidence: test name.
- **Docs Only** — documentation reading alone.
  **Insufficient** for load-bearing assumptions; allowed
  only when paired with a Spike or Source Search plan
  in the Evidence line.

A `Method: Source Search` whose Evidence cites this
same RDR file — or any path under the RDR's artifact
directory — is self-reference and not Verified. The
cited proof must also support **the specific claim**,
not an adjacent one: confirming a neighboring fact and
stamping the assumption `Verified` is not verification.
The cited symbol must resolve on `main` (a renamed,
deleted, or never-built symbol fails the check).

Any exactness claim such as all/every, first/nearest,
byte-identical, lossless, canonical, deterministic, or
stable order must be covered by a Critical Assumption
Evidence Record or by the Minimum Viable Validation.

## Proposed Solution

### Approach

[Detailed description of the recommended solution.]

### Technical Design

[Architecture, component relationships, data flow,
extension points.]

#### Normative Contracts

[Required — never omit. Load-bearing — implementers must match exactly.
The implementation prompt extracts REQ-N quotes from
this section. This section is also the **authoritative
list of the contracts this RDR owns**: a surface not
named here has no spec to test against, so during
implementation an un-named surface is a deviation, not
free latitude (see `prompts/implementation/launch.md`
Phase 2).]

> **Proportionality (split signal).** Count the
> *independent* load-bearing contracts this RDR is the
> sole author of (a distinct type design, a hash, a wire
> format, a taxonomy, a destructive-op policy each count
> as one). If an implementer would have to hold **more
> than one** such contract in working memory at once,
> this RDR spans more than one seam — split it along those
> seams rather than locking them together. The split test
> is **contract count, not word count**.

- Function/method signatures and type definitions for
  values that cross module boundaries
- Wire-format / on-disk / serialization grammars
- Error envelope shapes and error code enums
- For every introduced user-facing or system-facing
  surface, specify the I/O contract:
  - **Success output**: silent | single value | named
    structured format (link to grammar)
  - **Failure output**: human-readable | structured |
    both (give field-level shape if structured)
  - **Status / sentinel errors**: every distinct code or
    state with one-line user-visible meaning
  - **Preview / dry-run / validation-only mode**: exact
    shape; how it differs from committed success output
  - **Environment divergence**: what changes across
    interactive vs non-interactive, local vs remote,
    batch vs streaming, or equivalent execution modes

State each Normative item in a clearly labeled block,
e.g.:

```normative
func Check(sealed []op.Op, proposed []op.Op) Report
type Report struct { ... }
```

Every external API call inside a Normative block must
have a corresponding Critical Assumption Evidence
Record above (Method: Source Search or Spike, with a
greppable `path::Symbol` or command + output).

#### Load-Bearing Decisions

[Conditional — include only the classes this RDR
touches; omit (don't N/A-bullet) the rest. These four
decision classes are the ones implementation otherwise
invents silently, so each must carry **one explicit
answer** here when in play. This is targeted rigor on
the churn-prone decisions, not blanket detail.]

- **Identity** — what makes two of these things "the
  same"? (the equality/dedup/merge key)
- **Wire / byte format** — the exact layout, or
  explicitly deferred with the named owner.
- **Naming** — the canonical name, and the rejected
  alternatives.
- **Selection / predicate** — when N candidates qualify,
  *which one* is chosen and *why*.

#### Round-Trip / Inverse Invariants

[Conditional — include only if this RDR introduces a
pair of operations expected to compose to identity
(encode/decode, serialize/parse, import/export,
migrate/rollback, snapshot/restore, undo/redo). Omit
otherwise.]

State each invariant explicitly as `X ∘ Y = identity on
input class Z`, and specify the equality as **byte- or
value-for-byte fidelity** — *not* "does not error." A
green exit code does not prove the round-trip preserved
the input; the validation must assert the reconstructed
value equals the original. If the pair spans two RDRs,
also record it as a Critical Assumption with
`Method: Peer RDR` so Stage 8.1 asserts it across the
seam.

#### Illustrative Code

[Shape only — not load-bearing. Use sparingly; prose
is usually clearer.]

- Pseudocode showing algorithmic structure
- Sample invocations showing user-side syntax
- Examples of canonical-form output

Every example, fixture, sample input/output, numeric
count, and platform path is either **Normative** (tests
may assert it; cite the artifact or derivation) or
**Illustrative** (intent only; tests must not assert it
literally).

Do not include full class implementations,
config/schema definitions, or code for deferred
features. Do not annotate Verified/Assumed inside
Illustrative blocks; the surrounding prose makes
assumptions explicit.

### Capability Dependencies

[For each load-bearing behavior, state whether the
enabling capability exists now, is introduced by this
RDR, is provided by a predecessor, or is deferred.]

| Needed Capability | Source | Status | Spec Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Capability] | Existing / This RDR / Predecessor / Future | Available / Introduced / Deferred | [Impact] |

### Existing Infrastructure Audit

[List existing modules that overlap with proposed
components. For each, state whether to reuse, extend,
or replace, and name any known limit that affects the
spec.]

| Needed Capability | Existing Surface | Known Limit | Decision | Spec Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Capability] | [Module/path] | [Limit or none] | Reuse / Extend / Replace | [Impact] |

### Decision Rationale

[Why this approach over alternatives. Key factors,
how it addresses the problem, why alternatives were
ruled out.]

## Alternatives Considered

[Full analysis for seriously evaluated alternatives.
One-sentence rejection for trivially eliminated options.]

[Conditional scaffold — omit (don't N/A-bullet) the
`Alternative 1` block below if no alternative warranted
full analysis; the `Briefly Rejected` list alone is fine.]

### Alternative 1: [Name]

**Description**: [Brief description]

**Pros**:

- [Advantage 1]

**Cons**:

- [Disadvantage 1]

**Reason for rejection**: [Why this wasn't chosen]

### Briefly Rejected

- **[Alternative N]**: [One-sentence rejection]

## Trade-offs

### Consequences

[Positive and negative consequences of the chosen
approach.]

- [Consequence 1 — positive or negative]
- [Consequence 2 — positive or negative]

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: [Description]
  **Mitigation**: [How to address]

### Failure Modes

[Required — never omit. What breaks visibly? What fails
silently? Recovery path? How does a developer diagnose
the problem?]

## Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites

- [ ] All Critical Assumptions verified
- [ ] [Other prerequisites]

### Minimum Viable Validation

[Required — never omit. The single end-to-end proof that
the approach works. Must be in scope — not deferred.]

### Phase 1: Code Implementation

#### Step 1: [Title]

[Instructions]

#### Step 2: [Title]

[Instructions]

### Phase 2: Operational Activation

[Deployment, CI/CD, credentials, shared infrastructure.
Omit if not applicable.]

#### Activation Step 1: [Title]

[Instructions]

### Day 2 Operations

[Conditional — omit (don't N/A-bullet) this whole section
if this RDR creates no persistent resource. For every
persistent resource this RDR creates (collection, index,
data store, config entry), address management operations:]

| Resource | List | Info | Delete | Verify | Backup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Resource] | In scope / Deferred / N/A | ... | ... | ... | ... |

[If any operation is marked "Deferred," justify why
it is not needed for initial usability.]

### New Dependencies

[Conditional — omit (don't N/A-bullet) this section if no
dependency is added or updated. Dependencies to add/update.
For third-party: note license and whether legal review is
required.]

## Validation

### Testing Strategy

[Required — never omit. Test scenarios and coverage goals — what to test and
what constitutes "done." For non-functional concerns
(performance, security): state measurement strategy,
not estimates.]

1. **Scenario**: [Description]
   **Expected**: [Result]

### Performance Expectations

[Conditional — omit (don't N/A-bullet) this section unless
comparing alternatives on empirical performance grounds.
Do not include effort estimates or speculative
throughput targets. Rough performance metrics are
appropriate only when comparing alternatives — note
empirical data or obvious gains that support the
chosen approach over a rejected one.]

## Finalization Gate

> Complete each item with a written response before
> marking this RDR as **Final**. Written responses
> prevent rubber-stamping and produce a review record.
>
> First run the mechanical pre-sweep
> (`prompts/gate/tooling-pass.md`): TEMPLATE section
> coverage, Method-label vocabulary, `Source Search`
> self-reference, `Docs Only` on load-bearing claims. It
> catches what the review rounds disturbed; resolve any
> BLOCK before the written responses below.

### Contradiction Check

[State any conflicts between Research Findings and
the Proposed Solution. If none exist, state
"No contradictions found between research findings,
design principles, and proposed solution."]

### Assumption Verification

[Confirm every Critical Assumption Evidence Record
is internally consistent: Status, Method, and
Evidence agree, and "If wrong" is non-empty. List
any record whose Method is `Docs Only` (these block
lock unless paired with a Spike or Source Search
plan) and any that remain `Pending` or `Unverified`
with a plan to verify before implementation begins.
Confirm no `Verified` stamp is self-referential or
proves only an adjacent claim, and that each cited
`path::Symbol` resolves on `main`. **Status
consistency:** no assumption marked `Pending` or
`Unverified` may have settled-fact prose elsewhere in
the RDR depending on it.]

### Scope Verification

[Confirm the Minimum Viable Validation is in scope
and will be executed during implementation, not
deferred. State the specific test or proof.]

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

[List only concerns that apply to this RDR. For each,
state either how this RDR addresses it, or which peer
RDR owns the project-wide policy this RDR conforms
to. Omit (rather than N/A-bullet) anything that does
not apply.]

Candidate concerns (include only those that apply):
versioning · build tool compatibility · licensing ·
deployment model · IDE compatibility · incremental
adoption · secret/credential lifecycle · memory
management · concurrency model · character encoding ·
canonical-form / determinism (see note below).

If this RDR claims byte-identical output,
content-addressed identity, or replay-stable hashes,
also confirm: hash function + library, pre-image
byte layout, primitive encodings, map iteration order,
whitespace policy, case folding, empty/null/absent
distinguishability, and a version marker for future
evolution.

### Proportionality

[Is the document right-sized for the change? Flag
any sections that should be trimmed before locking.
The split test is **contract count, not word count**:
confirm this RDR is the sole author of at most one
independent load-bearing contract (per the Normative
Contracts split signal). If it owns more than one
seam, flag it for splitting rather than locking the
seams together.

Re-validate the **Profile** Metadata field against the
contracts you just counted: confirm the value Resolve
wrote still matches (one contract + no user-facing
surface → `small`; etc. per the applicability matrix).
If the lenses that actually ran disagree with the
Profile (e.g. Profile says `small` but the change locks
a contract that warranted `mid`+ lenses, or the lenses
were skipped on a wrong `small`), correct the field and
do not lock until the missing lenses have run. This is
the latch's backstop — a wrong Profile cannot route
past the lens battery undetected. Also confirm form:
value + one clause naming the contract(s); strip any
matrix/provenance prose left from the template or Seed
(it belongs in the template comment, not the instance).]

# intrastate — Recommendation Decisioning Records

Project-scoped RDRs for `intrastate`. Draft new RDRs from the shared
`TEMPLATE.md` in the RDR engine (`$RDR_HOME/TEMPLATE.md`); `/rdr-seed`
materializes a copy automatically. Rationale + the full stage flow live in the
engine README — this file is only the per-project index.
